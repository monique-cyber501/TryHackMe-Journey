# TryHackMe: Wireshark – Packet Operations

##  Overview

This room helped me dive deeper into **packet-level inspection** using Wireshark. I explored how to isolate, interpret, and extract meaningful data from captured network traffic — a skillset that directly supports SOC analyst responsibilities.


##  Skills Practiced

- **Display filtering** (e.g., `http`, `tcp`, `dns`, `ip.addr == x.x.x.x`)
- **Following TCP streams** to reconstruct file transfers and communication
- **Exporting objects** like images or text files from captured packets
- Reading and interpreting **protocol behavior**, headers, and payloads
- Navigating the packet details/bytes pane to extract hidden information
