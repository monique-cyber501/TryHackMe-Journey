# Challenge 02 – Defensive Security Introduction  
 
##  Objective  
Simulate the role of a SOC analyst by detecting and responding to a suspicious login attempt. Use basic investigation and defensive techniques to block a malicious IP and document the incident.

##  What I Did  
- Explored the fundamentals of blue team methodology in a real-world simulated environment.  
- Reviewed system logs to identify a suspicious login attempt coming from an external IP.  
- Confirmed the activity was unauthorized based on geolocation and behavior pattern.  
- Used basic terminal commands to blacklist the IP, simulating escalation and response protocols.

##  Skills Practiced  
- **Log file navigation and interpretation** 
- **IP investigation and geolocation analysis**  
- **Basic network defense via IP blocking**  
- **Contextual thinking** — matching log entries to potential threats

##  Key Takeaways  
- Small clues in logs often point to bigger security gaps.  
- Defensive work starts with detection — but it ends with **actionable response**.  
- Being methodical and calm is just as important as being technical.

##  Reflection  
Before this exercise, “defensive security” felt like a vague concept. After walking through the simulated SOC scenario, I now understand how real-world analysts must quickly assess logs, investigate suspicious behavior, and make smart decisions to protect the environment. I see the value in thinking like an attacker to build better defenses.
