# TryHackMe: Incident Response Fundamentals

## Overview

This room provides a practical breakdown of how cybersecurity teams manage and respond to incidents using a structured framework. It focuses on the **NIST 800-61** approach and walks through real-world concepts that are essential for anyone working in security operations or blue team roles.

---

## Objectives Covered

- Understand the full **Incident Response lifecycle**
- Learn how to structure incident response using the **NIST framework**
- Explore roles, responsibilities, and communication in an IR plan
- Recognize the importance of preparation, documentation, and evidence handling
- Gain insight into both the technical and procedural sides of response

## Skills Developed

| Category                      | Description |
|------------------------------|-------------|
|  Incident Response Theory   | Learned how NIST breaks down response into six repeatable phases |
|  SOC Analyst Awareness      | Gained clarity on how SOC teams detect, investigate, and respond to threats |
|  Threat Identification      | Explored methods for identifying indicators of compromise (IOCs) |
|  Containment & Eradication | Studied containment techniques and why timing matters |
|  Forensics & Documentation | Understood the value of preserving logs and maintaining chain of custody |
|  Post-Incident Review       | Learned how teams perform debriefs and strengthen future defenses |

## Key Takeaways

- **Preparedness is everything.** The faster your team can identify roles, assets, and response steps, the better the outcome.
- **Incident response is a team effort.** Communication plans and defined roles are just as critical as tools and alerts.
- **Every phase has weight.** Skipping containment or lessons learned can lead to deeper compromise or repeated attacks.
- **Documentation protects you.** If it’s not written, it didn’t happen—from evidence logs to decision records.

## My Learning Impact

Completing this room helped sharpen my understanding of what happens during a security incident beyond just the technical response. I now better appreciate the operational and legal implications of IR and how it connects directly to blue team roles like SOC analyst, incident handler, or forensic investigator.

As someone preparing for a cybersecurity career, this room gave me a foundational framework for how incidents are structured and responded to in the real world. It bridges theory and practice in a way that's easy to understand and apply.
