#  TryHackMe: Intro to SIEM


##  Room Overview  
This room provides a foundational, scenario-driven introduction to **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)** systems. It breaks down the purpose, components, and daily use of SIEMs within a Security Operations Center (SOC), guiding users through a practical threat investigation without requiring external tools or platforms.

This was an ideal starting point for learning how security teams leverage SIEMs to detect, investigate and respond to malicious activity across an enterprise network.

##  What I Learned  

- **What a SIEM does**: collecting, aggregating and analyzing logs in real-time  
- **Common data sources**: Windows logs, authentication attempts, group policy changes, etc.  
- **The role of log normalization and correlation**  
- **How alerts are generated** based on suspicious patterns  
- **Attack detection** through logical investigation, using indicators like failed logons, PowerShell execution and privilege escalation  
- **Incident response mindset**: piecing together events to trace the full attack path

##  Walkthrough Summary  

### 1. **What is a SIEM?**  
- Learned how SIEMs support monitoring, detection and compliance  
- Understood SIEM’s position within the SOC workflow and why they’re vital for blue teams  

### 2. **Understanding the Attack**  
- Analyzed a multi-step attack scenario starting with brute-force login attempts  
- Identified signs of lateral movement, suspicious scripts and user privilege abuse  
- Mapped security event types (Logon, PowerShell, Account Management) to stages of the attack lifecycle  

### 3. **Log Analysis Without Tools**  
- Practiced reading and interpreting raw Windows event logs  
- Followed a logical sequence of security events to reconstruct attacker behavior  
- Answered investigative questions using provided logs and context

##  Key Skills Gained  

- Basic log reading and event ID interpretation  
- Recognition of common attack signatures in logs (e.g., Event ID 4625 – failed login)  
- Logical threat investigation without relying on automation  
- Understanding how different event types connect in an actual attack chain  
- Awareness of how SIEMs generate value through correlation and visibility
