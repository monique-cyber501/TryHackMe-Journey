# Wireshark: The Basics – TryHackMe Lab

##  Lab Overview
Completed TryHackMe’s Wireshark lab to build practical network packet analysis skills using real-world capture files.

##  What I Learned
- Filtering network traffic using Wireshark display filters
- Identifying protocol behavior (HTTP, DNS, TCP, ICMP)
- Reconstructing transferred files from packet data
- Understanding how attackers hide or exfiltrate data

##  Skills Applied
- Network protocol analysis  
- Security investigation techniques  
- Practical use of Wireshark in threat detection  


##  Why This Matters
These skills are essential for roles in:
- SOC analysis
- Threat hunting
- Incident response

This lab helped bridge theoretical knowledge with tools I’ll use in real-world environments.
